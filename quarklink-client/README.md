# Quarklink Client Binaries

This repo has pre-built binaries of the Quarklink Client Library.

QuarkLink Client is a C library that implements the core functionalities of QuarkLink, to provide the user with an easy way to enroll to quickly and safely obtain the information needed to connect to their prefered IoT Hub.
This way the user can spend more time designing their application without focusing too much on connecting to the backend services.

See the [Quarklink Client Library](https://cryptoquantique.github.io/Resources/Documentation/QuarkLink-Client/index.html) documentation for more detailed information about the Library.
